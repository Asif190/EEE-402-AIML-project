Adaptive Multimodal Sentiment Analysis and Feedback Summarization


This repository contains the implementation of a multimodal machine learning system designed to analyze student feedback and generate data-driven curriculum optimization insights. The project integrates BERT-based textual embeddings with numerical academic metrics through a Modality Attention Gate (MAG) mechanism for sentiment classification across five levels. Additionally, it uses a fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model to generate course improvement suggestions and identify pedagogical limitations. It also features SHAP explainability for feature transparency and deploys decision logic to support curriculum revision or deployment. Developed as part of the EEE 402 Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Lab at BUET, the system offers a scalable pipeline for sentiment-informed educational analytics.

Key Features:

Multimodal fusion (text + tabular) using MAG-BERT architecture

Sentiment classification with SHAP interpretability

Curriculum optimization suggestions via fine-tuned FLAN-T5

Custom synthetic dataset generation and preprocessing

Modular, Colab-friendly Python codebase
